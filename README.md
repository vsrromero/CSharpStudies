# CSharpStudies

Welcome to the **CSharpStudies** repository! This repository contains a collection of exercises and projects completed as part of a C# course. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my learning progress and to serve as a portfolio for potential recruiters to review.

## About

The exercises and projects in this repository cover various topics in C#, including but not limited to:

- Basic Syntax and Variables
- Control Flow (Conditionals and Loops)
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- Data Structures (Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries)
- Exception Handling
- LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
- File I/O
- Asynchronous Programming

Each project is contained within its own directory, with a clear description and relevant code files. The aim is to demonstrate my understanding and application of C# concepts through practical examples.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- A folder with the name of the exercise containing the brief and the solution.
